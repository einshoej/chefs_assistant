**Tables**

When fetching data for a table, fetch all data, perhaps with the exception of meta-data and other columns that the user would never need.

Use the `column_order` variable in `st.dataframe` to select both which columns to display and the order of them.
This process allows the user to show hidden columns, or hide visible ones.

Use `st.column_config` to configure elements like label, help, and format for each column.

For number columns, like NAV (NOK), use `format = "localized"` to display numbers with proper thousand separators and locale formatting.

For percentage columns, use `format = "percent"` to display values as percentages (e.g. "1234.567" will be shown as 123456.70%).

A table should always be accompanied by the query used to fetch the data (unless the data has been manipulated before being shown), by the way of a tab. I.e., `st.tabs(["Table", "Query"])`.

```python
table_tab, query_tab = st.tabs(["Table", "Query"])
```
