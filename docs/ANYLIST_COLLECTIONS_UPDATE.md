# AnyList Collections and Photo Data Update

## Overview
This update enhances the AnyList integration to properly capture recipe collections (categories) and photo data that were previously missing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Node.js Bridge Updates (`src/anylist_integration/nodejs/anylist_bridge.js`)

#### Recipe Collections Mapping
- Modified `fetchRecipes()` function to:
  - Fetch user data containing recipe collections
  - Create a mapping of recipe IDs to their collection names
  - Include collections in the formatted recipe data

- Modified `fetchRecipeById()` function to:
  - Fetch user data and find collections for the specific recipe
  - Include collections in the formatted recipe data

- Updated `getCollections()` function to:
  - Actually fetch and return recipe collections from the API
  - Format collections with ID, name, recipe count, and timestamp

### 2. Recipe Display Updates (`src/pages/browse_recipes/recipe_display.py`)

#### Photo Display
- Updated to handle both old 'image' field and new 'photo' field structure from AnyList
- Properly checks for `photo.hasPhoto` and uses `photo.url` when available

#### Source Display
- Enhanced to show source URLs as clickable links when available
- Fallback to "AnyList" when no source is specified

## Data Structure

### Recipe Collections
Each recipe now includes a `collections` field:
```python
{
    "collections": ["Grønnsaker", "Vår", "Sommer", "Høst", "Vinter", "Tilbehør"]
}
```

### Photo Data
Recipe photos are now structured as:
```python
{
    "photo": {
        "hasPhoto": true,
        "url": "https://anylist-recipe-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/..."
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Test Script
A dedicated test script has been created to verify the Mashed Cauliflower recipe data:
```bash
python src/scripts/tests/test_mashed_cauliflower_data.py
```

This script verifies:
- Recipe photo presence and URL
- All expected collections are captured
- Other recipe metadata

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to AnyList Settings in your Streamlit app
2. Click "Sync Recipes" to fetch latest data
3. Go to Browse Recipes page
4. Search for "Mashed Cauliflower"
5. Verify:
   - Photo is displayed (if available in AnyList)
   - Collections are shown under "Categories"
   - All recipe details are properly formatted

## Expected Collections for Mashed Cauliflower
According to requirements, the recipe should have these collections:
- Grønnsaker (Vegetables)
- Vår (Spring)
- Sommer (Summer)
- Høst (Autumn)
- Vinter (Winter)
- Tilbehør (Side dishes)

## Troubleshooting

If collections are not showing:
1. Ensure the recipe is actually assigned to collections in AnyList
2. Re-sync recipes from AnyList Settings page
3. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Run the test script to verify API response

If photos are not showing:
1. Verify the recipe has a photo in AnyList
2. Check if the photo URL is accessible (not expired)
3. Look for any CORS or security errors in browser console

## Next Steps
After syncing recipes with these updates:
1. All recipes should display their assigned collections
2. Recipe photos should appear when available
3. The browse page will show richer recipe information
4. Collections can be used for filtering and organization
